# Mask_Detection

## Introduction
This is a real-time mask detection system that uses your camera to check if a mask is worn properly.

## How to Use
1. Run `main.py`.

2. Your camera will open automatically.

3. The system will detect your mask status:
   - A **green** square indicates the mask is worn **correctly**.
   - A **red** square indicates the mask is worn **incorrectly**.
